# **CVE-2017-7351**


**Vendor:** REDCap - https://projectredcap.org


**Affected Versions:** 7.0.X â€“ 7.0.10 


**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection


----------------------------------------------


**Vulnerability Details:**


```SendITController:upload``` on versions 7.0.X through 7.0.10 does not perform sufficient sanitization of user input.

Due to this, an attacker is able to perform Blind, Time-Based SQL injection against the backend database.

----------------------------------------------

**Proof-Of-Concept:**


```route=SendItController:upload' AND SLEEP(5) AND '1'='1```

This concept causes the application to pause for 5 seconds.

Identification of this vulnerability was performed on version 7.0.5, however REDCap confirmed that the handler was initially implemented in version 7.0.0, with the security mitigations being introduced in version 7.0.11.
